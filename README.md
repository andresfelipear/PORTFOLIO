# PORTFOLIO
My name is Andres Arevalo, I'm a web developer and this is my portfolio.

## Tecnologies
You'll find three projects (2 MERN APPS and 1 REACT APP)

## React Router and Netlify
When we deploy our react app with netlify, we have to create a field "_redirects" in the public folder. In this file, we have to specify when the user access a route where we have to redirect. Usually we just have to specify "/* / 200" which means: every route that the user access will be redirect to the main route.
